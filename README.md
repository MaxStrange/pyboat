# pyboat
This is no longer an effort to make a console-based gunboat game,
as I got tired of trying to write a UI (since it will be
more complicated than I had envisioned, and I don't care enough).

###INSTEAD:
This is a holding place for the code that will ultimately be
the AI for the gunboat game, whenever I get around to it.

It is entirely likely that I will NEVER get around to it
(as that's how these things go), but either way, the algorithm
should be sound and easy enough for anyone to understand and
take, should they feel the need to make a diplomacy bot of their
own.

The ai folder is where the AI is kept, and it shouldn't be too
terribly hard to understand how it works (or how it WOULD work
should I ever get around to scraping together a dataset and
training the neural networks that would be required).
